# MSIX-Power-Wrapper
An application wrapper that can be used to enhance MSIX/APPX packages. This the application mainly used within my MSIX packages which are available in the Microsoft Store.

Everything here is without warranty. Please note that my code started small to fix minor stuff and went on getting bigger and bigger. If you like to redefine stuff I am more then happy to see your input :).

And check out the <a href="https://github.com/Weatherlights/MSIX-Power-Wrapper/wiki">Wiki</a> for documentation.
