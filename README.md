# MSIX-Power-Wrapper
An application wrapper that can be used to enhance MSIX/APPX packages. This wrapper is one of the key components of my Microsoft Store migrated applications (like MPC-BE, PWSafe Store Edition, Autohotkey etc.) for over 7 years.

Features:
- Move configuration files
- Modify user registry
- Define in process ENV variables
- Handle updates from the Microsoft Store/Appinstaller
- Roam configuration data across machines
- Signed configurations
- Provide command line parameters
- Scripting logic for the most common issues

And check out the <a href="https://github.com/Weatherlights/MSIX-Power-Wrapper/wiki">Wiki</a> for documentation.

And everything here is without warranty. Please note that my code started small to fix minor stuff and went on getting bigger and bigger. If you like to redefine stuff I am more then happy to see your input :).
